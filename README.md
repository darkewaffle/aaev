# Auto Attacks Easily Visualized

## How To
1. Download aaev.lua, aaev_settings.lua and the libraries folder. aaev.lua and the libraries folder can be found in the zip file under [Releases](https://github.com/darkewaffle/aaev/releases). You only need to download the settings file if you do not already have one - although it could change over time as new settings are supported.
2. Place them in Windower\addons\aaev.
3. Modify aaev_settings.lua to your liking.
4. "lua l aaev" in game to initialize the addon.
5. Go melee attack stuff and AAEV will chart the results.
